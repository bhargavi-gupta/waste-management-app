= Project: Waste Management App

This project demonstrates how Internet of Things (IoT) integration with data 
access networks, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), combinatorial optimization, and 
mobile application development can contribute to improve citiesâ€™ management systems. A 
waste collection solution based on providing intelligence to trashcans, by using an IoT 
prototype embedded with sensors, which can read, collect, and transmit trash volume data 
over the Internet is presented.
